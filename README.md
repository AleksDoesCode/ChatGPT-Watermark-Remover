# GPT Watermark Remover

## What It Does

**GPT Watermark Remover** is a free online tool that removes invisible watermarks from AI-generated text. When you copy text from ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, or other AI assistants, these tools often embed hidden tracking characters that can cause problems.

## The Problem We Solve

AI language models insert invisible "zero-width characters" into generated text. These hidden watermarks:

- **Break code formatting** - Cause syntax errors and linting failures
- **Disrupt Git diffs** - Make version control messy and hard to read
- **Trigger plagiarism detectors** - Flag legitimate AI-assisted work
- **Fail copy-paste workflows** - Create unexpected formatting issues
- **Expose AI usage** - Track when and where AI-generated text is used

## Who It's For

### Developers & Engineers
Clean AI-generated code before committing to repositories. Fix broken linters, restore proper syntax highlighting, and eliminate Git diff noise.

### Students & Academics
